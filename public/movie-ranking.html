<h1>My Favorite Movies!</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Bubble Boy</h3>
    <p>This is one of the first movies I remember watching as a kid. I always have to explain what it is to people when I say it's my favorite movie.</p>

<h3>Matilda</h3>
    <p>I used to cuddle up on the couch every Saturday morning and watch this movie. It really made me want to make homemade pancakes, but the first time I tried, I used way too much flour... and didn't cook them all the way through. Yuck!</p>

<h3>The Last: Naruto the Movie</h3>
    <p>Naruto is a beautiful anime series, but something about this movie always sends me to my happy place. There's just something about Naruto and Hinata falling in love then fighting together that's so powerful.</p>
